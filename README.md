# Robotics_FinalProject
Metal and Plastic detecting Robot using IR and Inductive Proximity Sensors
- The main objective of this project is to classify metals, Plastic and Paper using a two Robots.
- We have used infrared and Inductive Proximity sensors to classify meterials. 
- We have used a conveyor belt to pass items and the robots will classify items using sensor output.

# Softwares Used.
- We have programmed robots and sensors using Arduino Mega.
- We have used motor drives to robots to control robots precisely.
- we have DC motors to run conveyor chain.
- Used Regulated power supply for DC Voltage and Current.

# Note:
- We have several issues while driving motors for conveyor belt. The DC motors produced low torques which is insufficent to run the conveyor,However we can acheive by using DC motors with high torque. as a remedy we hava manually operated the conveyor.

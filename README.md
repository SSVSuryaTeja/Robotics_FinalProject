# Robotics Final Project
Metal and Plastic detecting Robot using IR and Inductive Proximity Sensors
- The main objective of this project is to segregate metals, Plastic and Paper using a two Robots.
- We have used Inductive Proximity sensor to detect metals and infrared sensors to  differntiate between plastic and paper. 
- We have used a conveyor belt to pass items and the robots will classify items using sensor output.

# Projects Members:
- Arifa
- Divesh
- Manojna
- Surya

# Softwares Used.
- We have programmed robots and sensors using Arduino Mega.
- We have used motor drives to robots to control robots precisely.
- we have DC motors to run conveyor chain.
- Used Regulated power supply for DC Voltage and Current.

# Note:
- We have faced issues while driving motors of conveyor belt,as the torque produced by the DC motors is insufficent to run the conveyor. This issue can be overcomed by using motors of high torque, but for now we have operated the conveyor belt manually.

# Future scope:

IR spectroscopy or capacitive proximity sensors can be used for more accurate differentiation between the plastic and paper. 
IR spectroscopy can also be used to differentiate other materials like biodegradable materials, glass etc.
Computer vision can be used to detect the exact position of the object and the trash bin.

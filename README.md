# Robotics_FinalProject
Metal and Plastic detecting Robot using Captive and Inductive Sensors
- The main objective of this project is to classify metals, Plastic and Paper using a two Robots.
- We have used infrared and Inductive Proximity sensors to classify meterials. 
- We have used a conveyor belt to pass items and the robots will classify items using sensor output.
# Softwares Used.
- We have programmed robots and sensors using Arduino Mega.
- We have used motor drives to robots to control robots precisely.
- we have DC motors to run conveyor chain.
- Used Regulated power supply for DC Voltage and Current.
